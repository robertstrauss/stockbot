# Stock Bot
This is a discord bot which can give updates on stock quotes and prices.

Using the alpha vantage stock API, the bot fetches and sends to the chat a global quote on a stock given its symbol.

This code requires two files to be added:

token.txt - containing the bot token of a discord bot
apikey.txt - containing an API key for alpha vantage.

These are .gitignore d for privacy.
